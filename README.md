# Cpp-tricks
This repo includes some algorithmic tricks (complexity, frequency, sorting &amp; data structures  ...) implemented with C++ :
1- Introduction & Complexity of algorithms
2- Preprocessing frequency (count) arrays
3- Preprocessing Prefix (cumulative) sum
4- Partial sum
5- Sorting (Compare functions)
6- Overflow and type casting
7- Data structures (queue, stacks, sets and maps)
8- Dynamic programming I
